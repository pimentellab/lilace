__Lilace__ is an R package for scoring FACS-based DMS experiments with uncertainty quantification. It takes in a negative control group (usually synonymous variants) and scores each variant relative to the negative control group.

## Installation
Lilace relies on [cmdstanr](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/), which should be properly installed first. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))

# use cmdstanr to install CmdStan, this requires a working C++ toolchain and compiler
library(cmdstanr)
install_cmdstan(cores = 2)
```
The compiler requirements can be seen at [stan-dev](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Coding-Style-and-Idioms#supported-cpp-versions-and-compilers). If you run into issues with installation, please ensure your gcc version is > 5.

Then, install Lilace from GitHub.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("pimentellab/lilace")
library(lilace)
```
